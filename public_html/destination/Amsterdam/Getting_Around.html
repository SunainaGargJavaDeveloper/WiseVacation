<h2>Getting Around Amsterdam</h2>
	<p>The best way to get around Amsterdam is by bike. Once you’ve flown into the
            nearby Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) and settled into your hotel, we
            suggest you inquire about getting one. Numerous canals, impatient drivers
            and narrow roads (ringing the canal belt) make maneuvering the city via
            car interesting, to say the least. Plus Amsterdam is known for its biking,
            and you'll find that rental shops canvas the city. Pedaling through an
            unfamiliar place might not be everyone's schtick; for those travelers,
            there's also a perfectly respectable public transport system — the
            GVB — which offers metro, bus and tram service.</p>

<p>Getting around Amsterdam by car probably isn't the best method. If you do 
    decide to drive, frustration and expense will no doubt be your companions.
    Along with narrow, one-way roads, scarce parking — that's expensive to boot
    — and multitudes of pedestrians and cyclers on all sides, you also have a
    disorienting tangle of canals to grapple with. However, if you're planning
    on seeing other Netherlands destinations, renting a car does make a bit
    more sense. You can find rental places at the airport as well as a throughout downtown.</p>

<p><strong>Bus</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Amsterdam's public bus service is operated by GVB. Many of the buses begin their
    routes at Centraal Station, which is also one of the places where you can buy your
    <em>OV-chipkaart</em> or GVB ticket. Prices for all GVB public transportation are 
    allotted by time (1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours etc.), as well as by time of day.
    The GVB also operates night buses, but ticket prices for these are more expensive
    than their daytime counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>Metro</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Amsterdam also operates a small Metro system, with four numbered lines: 50, 51, 52
    and 53. Metro trains are mostly used by residents coming in from the suburbs.
    If you do decide to take the metro train, be sure to validate your ticket on
    the platform before hopping on.</p>

<p><strong>Tram</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>After walking or biking, the Amsterdam tram is the most scenic way to travel through
    the city. Sixteen tram routes crisscross the city and 10 of them, lines 1, 2, 4, 5,
    9, 13, 16, 17 and 26, begin and end service at Centraal Station. Board the tram 
    toward the rear, and to hop out, hit the button that reads "Deur Open."</p>

<p><strong>Ferry</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>To get across the IJ channel, you can take one of five ferry routes operated by 
    the GVB. Although you might enjoy a scenic view of the harbor, there's not a
    ton to do once you reach Amsterdam-Noord (North).</p>

<p><strong>Taxi and Water Taxi</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Metered taxis can be hailed on the street, called or picked up at taxi stands.
    However, in recent years, taxi service has become a little iffy with directionally
    challenged cabbies, who may or may not speak English. Taxi Centrale Amsterdam tends
    to offer trustworthy service. Water taxis in Amsterdam are very expensive, but they
    're also very ambient. If you can afford upward of $100 for a 30-minute ride, you 
    can hail one outside of Centraal Station.</p>

<p><strong>Bike</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Biking is the way to travel around Amsterdam. And you'll find that bike shops 
    — renting thousands upon thousands of bikes — fill the city. This is also an
    affordable way to get around — though you will have to make a hefty deposit 
    on your rental (around $100). Rentals cost somewhere around $15 a week to about
    $50 per week. Plus, you're getting exercise and burning off all those pancake
    calories. And if you're nervous about traffic, pedal around on Sunday when the city is sleepy.</p>
