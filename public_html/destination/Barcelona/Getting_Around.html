<h2>Getting Around Barcelona</h2>
	<p>The best way to get around Barcelona is by Metro. A handful of numbered
            and color-coded lines weave throughout the city, making stops near many
            of the city's most popular attractions, but unfortunately not at the airport.
            To travel from Barcelona Airport (BCN), you'll need to catch a taxi, ride a 
            bus or rent a car. Speaking of city buses, be aware that ever-present traffic
            jams make commuting via bus rather time-consuming. You could hail taxis on the 
            street, but if you want to burn a few calories, conduct your tour on foot or by 
            bike. Driving, however, is not recommended.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Metro</strong></p>
</td>

<p>Diamond-shaped signs wearing an "M" mark the locations of Barcelona's Metro stations.
    This underground rail system serves much of the city on eight color-coded lines.
    Tickets are transferable to city buses and trams. There are a variety of ticket 
    options available and they can be found here. If you're visiting Barcelona for a few 
    days to a week, the T-10 ticket, which costs €9.80 EUR (or roughly $13 USD), is your 
    best option. If you're in the city for a month or more, try the T-50/30, which is €39.20
    EUR (about $52) and offers you 50 trips over 30 days. The metro runs 5 a.m. to midnight
    Sunday through Thursday and on public holidays, 5 a.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays and evenings
    before public holidays and nonstop on Saturdays.</p>

<p><strong>Bus</strong></p>
</td>

<p>The city also operates an extensive bus system, but it's more prone to backups due to 
    the intense traffic. However, Nitbuses, which run from late night to the early morning,
    are especially useful to those visitors enjoying the city's nightlife scene. Bus hours 
    and timetables vary, so be surre to check the website for more information. Several special
    bus lines — called the Bus Turistic — offer routes that drop passengers at Barcelona's top attractions.</p>

<p><strong>Car</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Unless you're leaving the city, it's not recommended that you rent a car. Many of the narrow 
    streets were designed and constructed before the automobile was invented. Traffic jams and 
    lots of congestion are another reality. If you do rent one, you must be at least 21 years of 
    age with a U.S. state license, as well as an international driver's permit, which can be obtained 
    here.</p>

<tr>

<p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Metered taxis are bountiful. You can hail them off the street (green light means they're free),
    but keep in mind that daytime taxis are cheaper than nighttime ones. If you're traveling a 
    lengthy way at night, you might want to take the Metro or Nitbus instead.</p>
