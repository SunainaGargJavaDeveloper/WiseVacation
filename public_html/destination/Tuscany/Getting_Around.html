<h2>Getting Around Tuscany</h2>
	<p>The best way to get around Tuscany is by car - this gives you the freedom to explore all the towns nearby and yummy 
            restaurants in the country.&nbsp;You'll want to get out and explore the region so you can really get a feel for it
            and appreciate its charm and beauty. If you can't drive a stick shift, make sure to request an automatic because most
            Italians drive stick. If you think gas is expensive in the U.S., just wait til you get a load of the prices in Europe
            - you may think it's cheap until you realize it's being sold by the litre, not the gallon.</p>
        <p>There are many toll and free highways - and the road conditions are generally pretty good, so you shouldn't have
            too much trouble. Driving is on the right - which you might not expect if you've been driving around any other 
            parts of Europe. </p>
        <p>There is also&nbsp;public transportation in the form of buses and trains. Buses are usually the better option - there are 
            a number of lines that go between the smaller towns and cities. Sometimes it can be tough for non-native speakers to get
            information, but it's worth the hassle.</p>
        <p>You can bike around Tuscany, too. There are biking tours or you can rent a bike on your own and find routes in and around the city. </p>
        <p>Also, boats and ferries are a way to get around the area. If you want to explore the islands from the mainland, this is the only 
            way to get around.</p>
