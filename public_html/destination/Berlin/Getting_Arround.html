<h2>Getting Around Berlin</h2>
	       <p>The best way to get around in Berlin is via the U-Bahn underground trains
            or S-Bahn regional, elevated trains, which are both a part of the city's
            extensive BVG public transportation system. You can even take the U-Bahn
            from Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL), located a mere five miles from the city center.
            As with every big metropolis, driving is discouraged: heavy traffic and scarce
            parking are the main culprits. For a bit of exercise, you can also rent a bike 
            and peddle along the city's bike lanes and through the parks. Metered taxis are
            abundantly available, and these can be hailed on the street or scheduled ahead of time.</p>

<p><strong>U-Bahn &amp; S-Bahn</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Most tourists will use the U-Bahn to get around. This underground rail system runs on nine colored routes
    throughout the city and makes more than 170 stops. A ticket is required for riding, and if you're caught
    on the train without it, you can be fined astronomically. Make sure to also validate your ticket before 
    boarding. Note the price is variant on a zone system (A, B and C), but most of Berlin's attractions are
    situated in zones A and B, the cheapest price bracket. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You can also take the S-Bahn, which runs a handful of east-to-west and north-to-south lines, as well as a
    circular line, throughout the city. Fares are very cheap, and trains run about every five minutes during
    rush hour and about every 20 minutes on nights and weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Bus</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>An efficient bus system can also take you to most places in the city, though it's significantly slower than 
    the above- or underground trains. A common bus route is Bus Route 100, which departs from the Zoologischer
    Garten station, drives through Tiergarten park and onto Alexanderplatz, allowing riders to see some of Berlin's
    most famous landmarks. Buses nos. 216 and 218 are also popular since they travel outside the city to the lake 
    getaways of Wannsee Beach and <em>Pfaueninsel </em>(or Peacock Island).</p>

<p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>

<p>Metered taxis are available throughout Berlin. You can hail one on the street (an illuminated sign means it's free
    or call one to pick you up (0800-CAB-CALL).</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Car</strong></td>
<td>Cars are not a preferred mode of transportation. Along with many of the world's major cities, Berlin shares a 
    penchant for traffic congestion and too-few parking spots. Another very unique frustration is the inability to
    turn left on major thoroughfares; tram lines and other barriers block the way. But if you're set on driving,
    you can rent cars from American companies at the Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL).</td>
