        <p>The best time to visit London is in the spring&nbsp;when the temperatures
            are mild and the city's parks are green and blooming. However, late spring
            <span>–&nbsp;</span>along with summer <span>–&nbsp;</span>is also prime tourist
            season, and hotel and flight prices reflect the surge. You're more likely to find 
            airfare and accommodation deals in the fall and winter&nbsp;though you'll also encounter 
            chilly temperatures. It's important to note though that December in London is an incredibly 
            popular place to be during the holidays, so expect the streets to be crowded with both English
            and international tourists. And no matter when you travel, you should pack an umbrella: London
            is notorious for experiencing misty days and showers year-round. Another thing to keep in mind
            : it's nearly impossible to escape crowds in London. Along with being one of the biggest cities
            in Europe, it is one of the most popular destinations to visit in the world, so no matter what
            time of year you go, you're bound to run into lots of tourists.</p>

                        <p>Peak tourist season in London is pretty much all year-round, but late spring (and summer)
                            are especially busy. By making your London Town jaunt in late spring, you'll have the 
                            opportunity to witness the royal parks and gardens blossoming, and hit the city's weather 
                            sweet spot. However, the earlier you visit in spring, the more likely you'll run into slightly
                            smaller crowds. While fall and winter can be especially rainy, and summer can get a bit muggy,
                            spring in London enjoys a happy medium, with average temperatures hovering between the 50s and 60s.</p>

                        <p>London is still crowded with tourists well into mid-September, thanks to the mild 60 to 70-degree&nbsp;
                            temperatures. The photogenic autumn foliage also doesn't hurt either. If you're looking to really sink
                            your teeth into the culture, however, this is the best time to visit. These month's annual events, 
                            especially Guy Fawkes Night, are celebrations deeply rooted in not only London but England's history.</p>

                        <p>If you're looking to save a pound or two, travel during the chilly, winter season
                            (except for December when rates rise due to the holidays). Though temperatures average
                            in the 30- to 40-degree range, you'll be able to enjoy a more authentic London experience
                            sans large tourist hordes. Because the city sparkles with twinkling lights and festive events
                            during the holiday season, central London is usually overrun with holiday shoppers, especially 
                            at Oxford Street. If you're in London for the holidays, plan to take in the city's Christmas 
                            splendour away from popular shopping hot spots.</p>

                        <p>Fortunately, comfortable summertime temperatures (mid-70s Fahrenheit) make the tourist crowds a
                            little bearable. Don't leave your shorts home just yet; in recent years, London has experienced 
                            record highs in the lower 90s. Also, summer affords no relief from rain and subsequent humidity.
                            Packing an umbrella is a must.</p>
