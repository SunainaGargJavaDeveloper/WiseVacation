<h2>Getting Around London</h2>
	<p>            <em> </em>The best way to get around London is the rapid-transit London Underground, or what locals call "the Tube." You
            can even take the Tube from Heathrow Airport (LHR) <span>–&nbsp;</span>one of the world's busiest airports
            <span>–&nbsp;</span>into the city center. This widespread and efficient system stretches throughout London
            and beyond, and it is relatively easy to navigate. Buying an Oyster card will further simplify your travel since
            it can be used on the Underground system, as well as on city buses and other forms of transportation. Visitors 
            should also bring a comfortable pair of walking shoes since<em> </em>meandering is the most atmospheric way to
            traverse the city.</p>

<p>The London Underground, otherwise known as "the Tube," is simple to use and has extensive routes throughout the city and into 
    neighboring counties. Tickets and rechargeable Oyster cards can be purchased at stations; we recommend the pay-as-you-go Oyster
    card, which will allow you to travel throughout the Underground's nine zones (though the great majority of tourist attractions 
    are clustered in the first and second zones). Even if you don't plan on using the Tube throughout your entire stay, purchasing
    an Oyster card (versus a single-fare ticket) will always be cheaper. For instance, a single-fare ticket in Zone 1 is 4.50 pounds
    (about $6.50), while the Oyster fare is 2.40 pounds (about $3.50). Remember to touch your Oyster card to the yellow readers as
    you enter the Tube station and as you exit.</p>

<td><strong>Bus </strong></td>

<p>The allure to traveling by bus is that you get to see the sights. The London Underground is, well, <em>underground</em>, so 
    you miss out on the city's scenic views. Fares start at&nbsp;<span>1.50 pounds for a single ride, but keep in mind that
        buses don't take cash at all, so it's best to have a</span><span>&nbsp;topped-up Oyster card to pay for your trip.

<td><strong>Taxi</strong></td>
<td>
<p>London's infamous black cabs can be found throughout the city, as well as in designated lines at busy train stations, airports,
    and hotels. When you're hailing one on the street, keep in mind that a lit-up taxi sign means it's available. Cabs are metered,
    and the minimum fee is 2.40 pounds (about $3.50). You can pay with cash&nbsp;<span>–&nbsp;</span>or <em>quid</em>, as the Brits
    say <span>–&nbsp;</span>but many cabs accept credit cards, though there is a surcharge. You can tip as much as you want, but most
    cab riders tip to the nearest pound. Steer clear of unlicensed cabs, especially ones soliciting you; they're illegal in London
    and can be dangerous.</p>

<td><strong>Car</strong></td>

<p>Think twice before "hiring" or renting a car in London. For Americans used to driving on the right side of the road, keep in 
    mind that Londoners drive on the left. The cars are also usually manual; automatics tend to cost more. In addition, traffic
    and parking are awful, and petrol (or gas) is high. That said, you can hire cars at the airports or at many locations 
    throughout central London.</p>
