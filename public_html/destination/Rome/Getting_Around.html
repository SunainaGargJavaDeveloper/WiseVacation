	<h2>Getting Around Rome</h2>
	<p>The best way to get around Rome is on foot. And because many of the best attractions are clustered together in
            traffic-free zones, walking makes the most sense. However, some places, like Vatican City, are pretty far from 
            the central historic district, necessitating the use of the metro or a taxi. An express train can take you from
            the Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport (FCO) into the city center. Buses are also available, but these aren't 
            recommended because of crowded conditions aboard and heavy traffic outside. If you must bring a car to Rome,
            you should park it as soon as possible once you enter the city limits. Otherwise, you'll find heavy traffic,
            impatient drivers and pedestrian-only areas make driving around virtually impossible.</p>

<p><strong>On Foot</strong></p>
</td>

<p>Walking is an easy option, particularly as many of the city's top attractions are located in close proximity to one another.
    Wear some comfortable shoes for climbing the Spanish Steps, entering the Colosseum and venturing to the Roman Forum.</p>

<p><strong>Metro</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Traffic above ground is bad, so the subterranean metro is the quickest means of public transportation to get around. The metro 
    in Rome runs two lines and you'll find stations scattered throughout the city marked by signs with a big red "M" on them. You
    can buy tickets (€1.50 EUR one-way) at some metro stations and convenience stores throughout the city. Watch out for pickpockets
    when riding, and also beware of scam artists trying to sell you special tours or hotel rooms.</p>

<p><strong>Bus </strong></p>
</td>

<p>A bus ticket costs the same as one for the metro (€1.50 EUR), and these are available at bus terminals and convenience stores.
    Bus stops are marked by <em>Fermata </em>(or stop) signs. Pickpockets are also a problem here, so keep an eye on your wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The best way to get a taxi is to have your hotel concierge call one for you. Restaurants will call cabs, too. A bit expensive,
    taxis start around €3 EUR and charge about a euro for every kilometer traveled. If you call one, you should keep in mind that
    the meter starts from wherever that driver is summoned. Extra charges are tacked on for travel on Sundays, late at night and 
    for suitcases.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Car</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>If your goal is to enjoy a stress-free vacation, don't drive. Traffic is a nightmare, as is parking. The entire historic city 
    center is off limits to drivers during the day. And on the whole, Romans are a population of impatient drivers. But if you must,
    get an International Driver's Permit (just in case the rental company requires it), and book a car at the airport or an agency 
    located in the city.</p>
